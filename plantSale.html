                <td><textarea rows="4" cols="50">Royal Catchfly is one of a small number of red-flowered plants native to the Midwest, and one of very few red-flowered prairie plants. Royal Catchfly has been extirpated from several states, and is considered ‘Endangered’ or ‘Threatened’ by most states within its range. Royal catchfly occurs in prairies, savannas, barrens, and open woodlands, usually on well-drained, often rocky soils. The conversion of these habitats to agricultural use is a primary cause of decline. Ruby-throated hummingbirds are very effective at carrying pollen between subpopulations of royal catchfly, thus the birds’ presence helps maintain genetic diversity of this declining wildflower.</textarea></td>

Flat, pastel pink flowers with green and burgundy centers follow the sun like sunflowers. These showy flowers bloom from June to August and attract many bees and butterflies. This coneflower species is less vigorous than other species of the same genus, and for this reason, may be crowded out if planted with other coneflower species. Tennessee Coneflower's extensive taproot make it ideal for dry, well-drained sites with full sun. - From Prairie Moon </textarea></td>

They have bell-like flowers with colored centers and inflated bladders around the fruit that is poisonous until fully ripe. Ripe fruits are delicious, healthy, and stand to benefit from selective breeding. Last summer, I collected Clammy and Narrow-Leaf ground cherry seeds growing wild in caesar creek meadows and I can’t wait to see what these perennials do in ideal garden conditions.
