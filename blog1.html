    <p>Experienced gardeners will no doubt have heard of The Three Sisters. 
        The idea originated from Indigenous American Indians who discovered corn, beans, and squash grow well together given the strengths and weaknesses of each crop. 
        This is just one relatively new farming method attributed to the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Agricultural_Complex" target="_blank">Eastern Agricultural Complex</a>- one of the many independent inventions of farming across the world. 
        Last year, I tried a different variation of the Three Sisters that worked well. 
        Instead of using corn as a tall trellis for the beans and squash to climb I used sunflowers! 
        Wild annual sunflowers, I found, make a much better support system for beans because of their branching structure and many flower heads.
        Another important property of sunflowers is below ground: a deep anchoring taproot. Corn on the other hand is technically a grass with shallow roots and no branches.</p> 

    <p>There is another reason I propose for using sunflowers, it is speculative but backed by real ecological science. 
        Wild sunflowers are a keystone native species that provide pollen for specialist insects as well as food for insect herbivores.
        The insects that feed on corn are less diverse and more likely to be abundant in large numbers. 
        When insect communities are diverse, insect predators are more likely to be present. 
        The garden definitely needs diverse pollinators to fertilize flowers, but we also need more insect predators to control the mosquito population. 
        Sunflowers help with that more than corn.
