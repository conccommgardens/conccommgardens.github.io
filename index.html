            <h2>About Our Garden</h2>
            <p> The garden now consists of 62  beds, 40 beds are gardened by individuals and 22 are gardened communally with produce going to the Walnut Hills Kitchen and to the Open Door Food Pantry. 
                The garden uses numerous reclaimed materials:  a retention pond made of 200 used tires, a greenhouse made out of used windows, a tool bin made out of used doors,
                a brick patio made out of reclaimed bricks and compost bins out of used pallets pulled from dumpsters. </p>
            
            <p> In 2024, our gardeners grew thousands of dollars worth of high quality vegetables, herbs, berries, and more without using peticide or artificial fertilizer.
            We are just getting started, community members who want to grow with us or purchase our produce should come to shceduled events or get in touch!</p>
            
            <p>Concord Street Community Garden was started in 2010 through a partnership between the Civic Garden Center and several interested neighbors, including Tom and Mary Carson, 
                the owners of the lot. Formerly Washington Limousine Service, for a decade the lot had been a dump site.</p>
